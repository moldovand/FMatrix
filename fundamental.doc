NAME
       fundamental - computes the fundamental matrix from image point 
                     correspondences.

SYNOPSIS
       fundamental in_file1 in_file2 > outfile

DESCRIPTION
        The fundamental matrix is computed from two sets of corresponding
        points. "fundamental" reads input data from the two files whose
        names are given in the first and the second arguments. The format
        of the input files (in_file1 and in_file2) is as follows:

        (in_file1)           (in_file2)
        --------------       --------------
        sz                   sz
        x[1]    y[1]         x[1]'  y[1]'
             ...
        x[sz]   y[sz]        x[n]'  y[sz]'
        --------------       --------------

	sz          : number of corresponding point pairs
	x[i]  y[i]  : image coordinates of the i-th point in the
                      first frame.
	x[i]' y[i]' : image coordinates of the i-th point in the
                      second frame.

        The output of "fundamental" appears in the standard output. The 
        titles in the output (outfile) indicate:

	F      : computed fundamental matrix,
	F+, F- : standard deviation pair.

        These are 3 by 3 matrices normalized to norm 1. The fundamental
        matrix F is a matrix such that the following "epipolar equation"
        is satisfied in a statistically optimal
        manner:

                                /    \
              /           \    | x[i]'|
             | x[i] y[i] 1 | F | y[i]'| = 0,     i = 1, 2 ,..., sz.
              \           /    |  1   |
                                \    /

        The standard deviation pair {F+, F-} describes the reliability
        of the estimate.  For example, if F+ and F- coincide up to,
        say, three significant digits, the estimate F is guaranteed to
        have accuracy up to approximately three significant digits.
        This is a theoretical accuracy bound, and it is impossible to
        improve the accuracy any further for the given data.
